    <h2>When are you open?</h2>
    <p>The soup kitchen opens every weekend (Saturday and Sunday) at 11:00 am and serves until 2:00 pm. You are welcome to arrive anytime during that time. Eating here is like eating at a restaurant. You simply come in, find an open seat, and a volunteer will bring you a great meal.</p>
