    <h2>Volunteer Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Cultural sensitivity is essential. Take time to learn about the cultural backgrounds of the refugees you are supporting.</p>
    <p>Be patient and understanding. Many refugees have experienced trauma and face significant challenges adjusting to a new environment.</p>
    <p>Respect boundaries and privacy. Allow refugees to share their stories at their own pace.</p>
    <p>Focus on empowerment rather than dependency. The goal is to help refugees become self-sufficient.</p>
    <p>Coordinate with our refugee services coordinator to ensure consistent support and avoid duplication of efforts.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your compassion and dedication to supporting refugees in our community!</p>
